(name 'WebClient-Core-ar.16'message 'Three small fixes:* Allow the class-side convenience protocol to be used without requiring its user to close the connection. Instead, prefetch contents and close it implicitly which makes simple uses like "WebClient httpGet: ''http://www.squeak.org''" easier.* Fix a race condition in redirect handling. When a server would send a redirect with a ''Connection: close'' header, WebClient would ignore the header and rely on the stream to be closed by the remote. Most of the time that works fine ... but when the other server is far away it can fail because it takes more time to close the socket.* Fix the test for persistent requests to honor both ''Connection: keep-alive'' as well as the proper defaults based on HTTP protocol version.'id '31350815-dcb0-1d4a-beb3-1096e5245c7b'date '6 May 2010'time '8:57:30 am'author 'ar'ancestors ((id 'bbc708c3-ec1f-4844-8798-e2fcb37c9e81'))stepChildren ())
